Tracking for such response time begins after a Plan member&#x27;s call has entered the GimBooks Enterprise Support Team queue. A Plan member&#x27;s call will be placed in the GimBooks Enterprise Support Team queue after membership and Plan has been verified. The foregoing shall not be deemed a representation or warranty on gimbooks behalf regarding the time within which a resolution, if any, may be available for any particular incident.

                <p class="paragraph-15">Enrollment for an annual subscription for GimBooks Enterprise commits you to a 12 month term. You have elected to pay your annual subscription in equal payments over the course of 12 months. You must pay for all 12 months of the subscription in full based on the then current rate of GimBooks. If you choose to cancel inside the first 7 days, you can opt to receive a refund per the 7 day money back guarantee (see refund section below). However, if you choose to cancel after the first 7 days and prior to the end of month 12 you will be subject to a termination fee equal to the amount of monthly payments left on your annual subscription. For purpose of clarity, if you pay for 6 months and have 6 months remaining on your annual subscription, which starts at date of enrollment, you will be charged a termination fee equal to the then current monthly fee of QuickBooks Enterprise multiplied by 6 months (remaining months left on annual subscription).

                <h1 class="heading-18">Renewal Policy<br></h1>
                <p class="paragraph-15">The initial Plan term covers one year from the date of purchase of your GimBooks Enterprise software. As of each annual anniversary date thereafter, your Plan shall automatically renew when Gim infotech pvt ltd. receives your payment. For Plan renewal, you must have a valid credit card or a valid debit card with a Visa or MasterCard logo (&quot;Card&quot;) or sufficient funds in a current or savings account to cover an electronic debit of the applicable Plan fee. The information you provide must be accurate and complete. When you subscribe and provide payment information, your Card or bank account will be debited immediately, and thereafter will be automatically re-debited on a yearly basis at the then-current rate to maintain the Plan unless, not later than 5 days prior to the beginning of the new one-year term, you notify Gimbooks to cancel the Plan. If the automatic renewal payment cannot be processed, Gimbooks will allow a 15-day grace period from your renewal due date after which date access to the plan and your account may be denied. If you cancel, the 15-day grace period does not apply. In the event an account is denied due to non-payment, it is policy to only retain your online data for 60 days after your designated Plan renewal date. The Plan may be terminated by Gimbooks immediately and without notice if a Plan member fails to comply with any term or condition of this Agreement, or if a Plan member exceeds reasonable use of the Plan, or if Gimbooks is unable to debit a Plan member&#x27;s Card in accordance with this Agreement. If Gimbooks chooses not to renew a Plan on the basis of excessive usage, such non-renewal will not preclude Plan member&#x27;s access to Gimbooks customer support on a pay-as-you-go basis or under a limited incident plan, if available. From time to time gimbooks may change the terms or conditions of the Plan, the method of Plan access or delivery, or the Plan fees.<br></p>

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, GIMBOOKS, ITS AFFILIATES AND ITS SUPPLIERS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR FOR ANY DAMAGES RELATING TO LOSS OF BUSINESS, TELECOMMUNICATION FAILURES, THE LOSS, CORRUPTION OR THEFT OF DATA, VIRUSES, SPYWARE, LOSS OF PROFITS OR INVESTMENT, TAX POSITIONS TAKEN BY YOU, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF GIMBOOKS, ITS AFFILIATES, ITS SUPPLIERS OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND EVEN IF A REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

If, during the first 7 days of Plan enrollment the Plan member has made no use of the Plan, the full amount paid for the current Plan membership period will be refunded. If the Plan member has received Data Recovery or Password Removal Services during the first 7 days of Plan enrollment, GImbooks will deduct the fees for the service(s) used from the refund amount. If the Plan member has received a version upgrade of QuickBooks Enterprise software within 7 days prior to the date a request for Plan cancellation is received, the suggested retail price of the GimBooks Enterprise Business Management software version upgrade(s) provided will be deducted from the refund amount.<br></p>
